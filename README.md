### Criteria 5
Overall the students proposed architecture is complete and executable in part b of the project.
### Meet Specifications
Students project is in scope and is possible for next phase of project build. Students diagrams contain a minimum of 3 different actors (to allow for an intermediary aside from buyer and seller) and a minimum 4 different states (simple example is for sale, bought, shipped, received).

The diagrams contain 4 different actors and 7 different states.
